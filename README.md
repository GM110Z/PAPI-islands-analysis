**Heatmap-generator** Uses PADLOC or AMRFinder outputs to generate heatmaps of presence/absence that can be then used in R

**jarvis.py** Starting from a list of IDs that where already characterised (by  PADLOC or AMRFinder, or whatever else) jarvis elminates them from the file of representive sequences that is produced
by MMseqs to be used for further analysis 

**SPIDERMAN.py** SPIDERMAN (System for Pathway Identification, Data Extraction, and Retrieval with Marvelous ANalysis) uses a tabled outputted from BlastKoala to map KEGG Ids to Kegg pathways and plots the pathways in a piechart
